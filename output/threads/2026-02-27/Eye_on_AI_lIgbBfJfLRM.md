## 📰 SUMMARY ARTICLE

# The AI Evolution: Why Better Selection is More Powerful Than Bigger Models

**TL;DR:** This interview with a Sakana AI founder reveals a paradigm shift in AI development.  Instead of solely pursuing ever-larger models, the future lies in evolutionary AI – using AI agents to select, combine, and even *design* better algorithms. This approach allows for leveraging both open-source and closed-source models, unlocking unprecedented potential.

### 🔑 Key Insights
*   **Evolutionary AI is the Next Frontier:** The interview highlights a shift away from brute-force scaling of models towards evolutionary strategies, mimicking natural selection to improve AI.
*   **Collective Intelligence Matters:** The speaker argues that AI, like human intelligence, is a collective effort, emphasizing the potential of combining multiple models and agents.
*   **AI Scientists are Emerging:** AI systems are now capable of generating and refining AI training algorithms, marking a significant step towards AI designing AI.
*   **Combining Closed and Open Models:**  Sakana AI is pioneering techniques to effectively combine proprietary (closed-source) models with open-source alternatives, overcoming limitations of weight access.
*   **Embracing "Hallucinations" for Innovation:** The speaker suggests that even AI "hallucinations" can be valuable, as they can lead to unexpected breakthroughs and novel solutions.

### 🧠 Deep Dive

**The Crisis That Sparked a Revolution**

The speaker's background in finance, particularly his experience during the 2008 financial crisis, profoundly shaped his perspective on risk, resilience, and the unpredictable nature of complex systems.  This realization, he argues, fueled his interest in evolutionary approaches to AI, recognizing that rigid, top-down systems are inherently vulnerable to unforeseen events.  "I feel like having lived went through the the financial crisis in 2008 it really made me learn about uh extreme events in the world."

**Beyond Brute Force: The Power of Selection**

The conventional AI narrative has centered on scaling – bigger models, more data, greater computational power.  While this approach has yielded impressive results, it's also reaching its limits.  The speaker champions a different path: evolutionary AI, where multiple agents are tasked with solving the same problem, and their solutions are then combined and refined through a process of selection, much like natural selection. This approach allows for the exploration of a wider solution space and can lead to more robust and adaptable AI systems.

**The Rise of AI Scientists**

Perhaps the most striking revelation is the emergence of “AI scientists” – AI systems capable of generating new AI training algorithms.  These systems, leveraging large language models, can propose, test, and refine training methods, effectively automating the process of AI development.  Sakana AI’s "Disco Pop" project demonstrated the ability of LLMs to conceive of new LLM training algorithms, highlighting the potential for AI to accelerate its own evolution. "We actually called this idea internally called LLM squared."

**Unlocking the Potential of Closed-Source Models**

A key challenge in AI research is the increasing prevalence of closed-source models, where access to the underlying weights is restricted.  Sakana AI is addressing this challenge by developing techniques to combine these models without direct access to their internals.  This is achieved by prompting and searching across models, effectively leveraging their strengths while mitigating their limitations.  "Our observation was we have like a a large ecosystem of open source models developed enthusiastically by many people working on AI models and we have closed models developed by all these great companies like Google open AI uh coher anthropic and in China deepseek and Alibaba and so on."

### 💬 Notable Quotes
> "I think in the field of uh neuroeolution or evolutionary computation there are many ideas that are broader which appeal to me uh there's the idea of you know not not just sticking to systems where you can calculate the gradients uh to do something because I think in in our world like many things uh many problems are such that there's actually no particular gradient signal in and the idea that if you just chase the gradient sometimes you can get stuck uh sometimes you kind of have to wander around the solutions to find an even better solution."

### 🏁 Conclusion

The interview offers a compelling vision for the future of AI, one where innovation isn't solely driven by brute force but by intelligent selection, collaboration, and self-improvement.  The emergence of evolutionary AI and AI scientists signals a profound shift in the field, promising a future where AI not only solves problems but also designs and evolves itself.
