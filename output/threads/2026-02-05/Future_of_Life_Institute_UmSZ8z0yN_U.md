# AI Scientist Warns: 95% of Jobs Could Get Automated (2026-02-05)

Post 1: 🤯 95% of *your* job could vanish? A leading AI scientist just dropped a bombshell warning about the future of work. It's not about robots replacing a few tasks... it's a potential seismic shift. ➡️ Show more #AI #FutureOfWork #Automation #AGI

Post 2: The expert isn't worried about *AGI* (human-level AI) itself, but the *speed* at which AI, even in its current form (LLMs), can automate tasks. "95% of human jobs can be done without fundamental creativity." 😳 It's already possible, just not widely deployed. #LLMs #AIrisk

Post 3: "We could roll out deep neural net driven systems to do a tremendous variety of human jobs *right now*." The bottleneck? Not tech limitations, but societal inertia. Think McDonald's drive-thrus – AI could've automated it years ago, but didn't. 🐌 #TechAdoption #Resistance

Post 4: The "why" is fascinating: Organizational issues, legal professions resisting change, even human psychology ("people are jerks and want to steal stuff"). AI adoption is gated by human behavior, not just code. 🤯 "The bar is pretty high." #HumanBehavior #AIethics

Post 5: The expert predicts a “massive job obsolescence wave” within 3-6 years after human-level AGI is achieved. It’s not a gradual shift, but a sudden, disruptive change. 🌊  He also warns about an AGI arms race & the need for responsible development. #AGI #AIarmsrace

Post 6:  Key takeaways:
* LLMs are more capable than many realize.
* Social & psychological factors slow AI adoption.
* AGI could trigger rapid job displacement.
* Alignment & ethics are *critical* – aligning AI with human values is a huge challenge.

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A hyperrealistic, slightly unsettling digital painting depicting a vast, empty cityscape dominated by towering, sleek AI infrastructure. In the foreground, a single, silhouetted human figure gazes out at the scene, their expression a mixture of awe and apprehension. The color palette is cool blues and greys, with subtle neon highlights. Style: Photorealistic, dystopian, futuristic. Aspect Ratio: 16:9
