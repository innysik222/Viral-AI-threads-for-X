# How AI Is Fixing the Biggest Bottleneck in Construction (2026-02-01)

Post 1: 🤯 Construction hasn't meaningfully innovated in 50 YEARS?! We’re talking ZERO progress while tech leaps ahead. This interview reveals the shocking bottleneck & the AI startup tackling it head-on. You won't believe how they're doing it... 🧵 #AI #ConstructionTech #Innovation

Post 2: The problem? Construction is drowning in manual processes. 🧱 Architects design, then EVERY subcontractor (tiles, carpet, etc.) manually measures those plans! "They go and open a file and some program and they trace around the room." 🤯 It's a HUGE waste of time & money. #ConstructionProblems

---
Post 3: Enter Togo AI. Their solution? AI-powered "takeoff" – instantly calculating measurements from architectural plans. 🤖 No more manual tracing! This alone saves massive time & reduces errors. They’re also building a "perception layer" for construction – teaching AI to *see* like a builder. #AIinConstruction

Post 4: 🗣️ CTO Ole Barasa: "Construction is resistant to *bad* technology, not technology itself." This is key! It’s not about slapping AI on anything; it’s about solving real, painful problems. They're focused on pre-construction - a massive, overlooked opportunity. #TechAdoption

---
Post 5: It's not just about speed, it's about *understanding*. 🧠 Togo's vision: AI agents that can reason, suggest material substitutions, and even (eventually) generate entire building plans based on your specifications! Imagine: "I want a building on the beach, Italian Baroque style..." 🤯 #FutureofConstruction

---
Post 6: The ROI is huge. 💰 Togo claims 90% efficiency gains in estimating alone! But the real value is in collaboration, error reduction, and unlocking new design possibilities. Ole: "You are the captain of the ship. We give you the tools." #Productivity #AItools

---
Post 7: The construction industry is ripe for disruption. 🚀 While the "bits" world moves at warp speed, the "atoms" world lags behind. Togo AI isn’t just automating tasks; they're fundamentally changing how we build. What other industries are ripe for this kind of AI-powered revolution? 🤔 #ConstructionRevolution

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A futuristic, stylized architectural blueprint overlaid with glowing, intricate AI network visualizations. The blueprint depicts a sleek, modern building rising from a lush, tropical landscape. The color palette is a blend of cool blues, greens, and vibrant oranges, symbolizing the intersection of technology and nature. The overall aesthetic should convey innovation, precision, and a sense of boundless possibility. Cinematic lighting, hyperrealistic detail.
