Post 3: 🤯 The current pre-construction process is WILD. Architects design, then EVERY subcontractor manually measures from those plans – tracing lines, counting doors. It's literally 1976. Togal is automating this, saving countless hours. 📏➡️🤖 "We give it to you for free because that's where AI shines." #Efficiency #Automation

Post 4:  Togal's approach: "You are the captain of the ship." 🚢 They provide AI-powered tools but empower users to maintain control & expertise.  Key takeaway: AI isn’t replacing humans; it's augmenting their capabilities. #HumanAICollaboration #ConstructionLeadership

Post 5:  The vision?  🗣️ "Someday you will be able to say I want a building in this place... and it will generate plans & materials."  A fully AI-driven design-to-build process.  Still 10+ years out, but the direction is clear. 🔮 #FutureofConstruction #AIvision

Post 6:  Ole Barasa (CTO, Togal) highlights a crucial point:  Construction is deeply rooted in physical realities, making tech adoption challenging. “It's not about technology as much as it has not been about technology as much… it was more about people systems."  #ConstructionInsights #PeopleOverTech

Post 7: Alpha Take: Construction is a massive, overlooked opportunity for AI. Togal isn't just automating tasks; they're rethinking the entire pre-construction workflow.  What other industries are ripe for this level of AI-driven disruption? 🤔 #AIInvesting #ConstructionRevolution
