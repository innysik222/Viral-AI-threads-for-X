# If You Can't See Inside, How Do You Know It's THINKING? [Dr. Jeff Beck] (2026-01-31)

Post 1: 🤯 Can an AI *really* be an agent if you can't peek inside its code? Dr. Jeff Beck dismantles our assumptions about agency & intelligence in this mind-blowing interview. Are we anthropomorphizing algorithms? 🧵👇 #AI #Agency #Philosophy #DeepLearning

Post 2: Beck argues geometric deep learning & incorporating physical symmetries are *essential* for modeling the world. It’s not just about writing code, but understanding the fundamental laws governing reality. 🤯 #Physics #AI #Modeling

Post 3: Dialogue Reconstruction: "An agent is a really sophisticated object... it has internal states that represent things over very long time scales." – Dr. Beck. It’s not about *doing* but *representing* – a crucial distinction! 🤔 #AIdefinition #Agent

Post 4: The "agency" litmus test? Can you identify planning & counterfactual reasoning from *external* observation alone? Beck says no. It’s about sophistication, not just input-output. 🤯 #Intelligence #ExternalObservation

Post 5:  Even a rock can be an "agent" under Beck's definition - anything with an input, policy, & output relationship. It’s the *degree* of sophistication that matters.  🤯 Transfer entropy is key to measuring that “agency strength.” #AgentTheory #Data

Post 6:  Beck warns against naive AI optimism. "I don't think that like you know you know these sort of prediction based approaches to like AI... are necess you know you could sort of say well it's not really doing anything even remotely agentic." Beware of superficial intelligence. ⚠️ #AIEthics #AIrisk

Post 7: Alpha Take: Defining "agent" based solely on observable behavior is a trap. We need to be wary of projecting human qualities onto complex systems. Are we truly understanding AI, or just creating convincing illusions? What metrics *really* measure intelligence? 🤔 #FutureofAI #ThoughtProvoking
