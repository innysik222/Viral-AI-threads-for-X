Okay, here's a draft X (Twitter) thread based on the provided transcript, designed for high engagement and viral potential. I've focused on the core argument about loss functions and the brain's complexity, and structured it for maximum impact.

**Post 1: [Hook]** 🤯 AI is *way* behind the human brain. We're throwing data at LLMs, but they're still toddlers compared to a 5-year-old. What's the missing ingredient? It might be something weirder than you think... 🧵 #AI #Neuroscience #AGI

---
**Post 2:** The big question: How does the brain *actually* do it? Adam Marblestone (Convergent Research) argues we're missing a crucial piece. It’s not just architecture or data… it’s about the *loss functions* – the "reward signals" guiding learning. 🧠 #Brain #Learning

---
**Post 3:** "Evolution may have built a lot of complexity into the loss functions…many different loss functions for different areas turned on at different stages of development." - Adam Marblestone.  LLMs use simple loss functions ("predict the next token"). Evolution? Not so simple. 🤯 #Evolution #LossFunctions

---
**Post 4:** Think of it this way:  LLMs learn to predict the next word. The brain? It's predicting *everything*. “Omnidirectional inference… any area of cortex is just trying to predict…any subset of all the variables it sees from any other subset.”  🤯 #AIlimitations #BrainPower

---
**Post 5:**  The core idea:  The brain's "reward system" isn't just a single signal. It's a complex, multi-faceted curriculum, encoded over millennia. It’s learning to predict not just *what* to do, but *why* you're doing it. 🤯 #RewardSystem #AIAlignment

---
**Post 6:** Marblestone highlights that neuroscience is key to unlocking this.  It's not just about bigger models; it's about understanding *how* the brain learns.  "We have to empower the field of neuroscience…to actually be able to crack a question like this." 🚀 #Neuroscience #Tech

---
**Post 7: [Alpha Take & CTA]** The real AGI breakthrough won’t be bigger models – it’ll be understanding the brain's learning *curriculum*. What if we could design AI with those same complex, evolutionary-optimized loss functions?  What are the implications for AI safety and beyond? 🤔 #AGI #FutureofAI
