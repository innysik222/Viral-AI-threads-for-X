# Adam Marblestone – AI is missing something fundamental about the brain (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 AI is *still* miles behind the human brain. Why? It's not just about data. Adam Marblestone argues we’re missing a fundamental piece of the puzzle – and it’s buried deep in neuroscience. Prepare to question everything you thought you knew about LLMs. 🧵👇 #AI #Neuroscience #AGI

Post 2: Marblestone’s core question: How does the brain *actually do it*? LLMs are data-hungry beasts, yet remain far from human capabilities. He believes we're chasing the wrong answers. "Maybe the way we think about this now... is that there are certain key components that we’re overlooking." #AIresearch

Post 3: The missing link? Not just architecture or hyperparameters, but *loss functions*. “Evolution may have built a lot of complexity into the loss functions... many different loss functions for different areas turned on at different stages of development." 🤯 This is HUGE. #lossfunctions #evolution

Post 4: Dialogue Reconstruction: "LLMs are just predicting the next token. But what if the cortex is natively made so that *any area* can predict *any pattern* in its inputs?” – Adam Marblestone. He calls it "omnidirectional inference." A radical departure from current AI. #probabilisticAI

Post 5:  He argues we need to empower neuroscience, not just throw more data at AI. Think: understanding the *Steering Subsystem* - the part of the brain driving innate responses.  "It’s not just about reward; it’s about what the brain *learns* to value."  #neuroscience #AGI

Post 6:  Marblestone connects AI progress to funding neuroscience research, particularly connectomics (mapping brain connections). He believes scalable infrastructure in neuroscience unlocks breakthroughs across fields, even math!  Formalizing math proofs, for example. 🧠✨ #connectomics #math

Post 7: Alpha Take: Current AI is a clever approximation, but missing the profound complexity of biological learning. Prioritizing neuroscience research isn't just about understanding the brain; it’s about unlocking the *next* generation of AI. What if the most valuable data isn't data at all? 🤔 #futureofAI

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized, ethereal depiction of a human brain interwoven with a complex neural network diagram. The brain is rendered in a vibrant, bioluminescent style, while the network appears as a subtle, intricate overlay. The color palette should be a blend of deep blues, purples, and electric greens, conveying a sense of mystery, complexity, and emergent intelligence. Subtle, flowing particles of light should emanate from the intersection of the brain and the network, symbolizing the potential for breakthrough discovery. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of awe and profound scientific revelation.
