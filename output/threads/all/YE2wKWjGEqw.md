Here's a Twitter thread based on the interview transcript, designed for high engagement and viral potential:

**Post 1: [Hook]**
🤯 Construction hasn't innovated in 50 YEARS?! Seriously. We’re talking zero progress while tech leaps forward everywhere else.  This interview reveals a hidden crisis & the AI startup tackling it.  You won't believe how they're doing it. 🧵 #AI #Construction #Innovation #Tech

**Post 2:**
The Problem: Construction is stuck. 🧱 Decades of stagnation, inefficient processes, & a resistance to change.  "Construction is resistant to technology. But I found construction is resistant to *bad* technology." – Ole Barasa, CTO @TogalAI.  #ConstructionTech #AI

---
**Post 3:**
🤯 The "Manual Takeoff" process is wild. Architects design, then *every* subcontractor manually measures those plans, tracing lines on a screen! 🤯 Ole: "It's not the most efficient process, but for every building, even the smallest, it happens hundreds of times."  #WTF #Efficiency

---
**Post 4:**
Enter @TogalAI. They're using AI (specifically computer vision & LLMs) to automate this manual process. 🤖 They’re giving contractors the measurements instantly, freeing them up for higher-value tasks.  "You want to design, like, and understand how to build this better." #AIinConstruction

**Post 5:**
🔑 Key Takeaways from the interview:
*   Pre-construction is ripe for AI disruption.
*   Togal is creating a "system of record" for construction.
*   They're building "agents" to automate back-office tasks (RFI generation, material selection).
*   The vision? AI-generated building plans! 🤯 #FutureofConstruction

**Post 6:**
Ole’s Alpha Take: "I think the limiting factor [in construction innovation] isn't the technology... it's the people systems."  Deep truth. Transforming an industry requires not just tech, but shifting ingrained practices and mindsets. #Leadership #ChangeManagement
