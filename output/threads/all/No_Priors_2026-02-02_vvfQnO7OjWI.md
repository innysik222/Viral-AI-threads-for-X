# How Until is Engineering Away Time in Organ Transplants | Laura Deming (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 Imagine a future where organ transplants aren't dictated by a frantic race against the clock. What if someone on death's doorstep could *pause* time until a cure arrives? Laura Deming & @UntilHQ are making this sci-fi dream a reality. ➡️ Show more #longevity #cryopreservation #futuretech

Post 2: Laura Deming, founder of Longevity Fund & CEO of @UntilHQ, is tackling a seemingly impossible problem: reversible cryopreservation. Not just for humans (eventually!), but *first* for organs. 🤯 "Making time not a variable changes the whole paradigm." #medicalinnovation

Post 3: The core challenge? Ice formation. 🧊 "Water expands when it forms ice. That's just hard for your tissue to take." BUT – there's a "temperature below which ice formation stops." @UntilHQ is engineering a path *below* that threshold. #science #engineering

Post 4:  🤯 Fun fact: human embryos are *already* cryopreserved for decades!  "There are kids who were literally cryerved for 30 years as tiny embryos." The question isn't *if* it's possible, but *how* to scale it. #bioengineering #medicalbreakthrough

Post 5: Deming: "I come from a longevity background, but reversible cry preservation is applicable a bit outside that as well." 🚀 The implications are huge: extending lifespan, pausing time for critical therapies, even (eventually) whole-body preservation. #futureofmedicine

Post 6:  @UntilHQ's goal: "To create a new form of critical care." Think ambulances of the future, pausing time for patients awaiting life-saving organ transplants. ⏳ "The tagline is like single years can make the difference between a patient dying...and living." #organTransplant #criticalcare

Post 7:  Deming’s vision isn't just about extending life; it’s about *reshaping* time itself.  Could this technology fundamentally alter how we approach disease, aging, and even space exploration? What ethical considerations will arise? 🤔  #future #technology #ethics

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A bioluminescent, ethereal scene depicting a single human heart suspended within a crystalline structure, subtly glowing with a soft, blue light. The background is a swirling nebula of colors, suggesting both the vastness of space and the intricate complexity of cellular life. The overall aesthetic is futuristic, hopeful, and slightly surreal, evoking a sense of suspended time. Style: Photorealistic, cinematic lighting, trending on ArtStation.
