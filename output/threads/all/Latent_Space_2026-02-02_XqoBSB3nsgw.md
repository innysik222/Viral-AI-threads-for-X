# 🔬 From Red Teaming GPT-4 to Automating Drug Discovery: The Future of AI in Science — Andrew White (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 Forget protein folding breakthroughs. The *real* revolution wasn't AlphaFold – it was the realization that solving it on a desktop was possible. Andrew White reveals a hidden history of failed, multi-million dollar attempts & the humbling truth about AI's potential. 🧵👇 #AI #Science #DrugDiscovery

Post 2: 💥 The Desha Research story is WILD. They built custom silicon & clusters, burned algorithms directly into chips, & ran massive MD simulations... only to be eclipsed by AlphaFold's desktop accessibility. “I always thought protein folding would be solved by them, but it would require a special machine.” #MachineLearning

Post 3: 🤝 The AI/science divide is dissolving. Andrew emphasizes the critical need for *both* domain expertise & AI engineering. "You need people on both sides of the aisle who can really talk to each other." It’s not just about algorithms, it's about understanding the nuances of the system. #Collaboration #Innovation

---
Post 4: 🧪 Andrew’s journey from academia to startup founder is fascinating. He realized automating science isn't just about writing code - it's about fundamentally rethinking the scientific process itself. “Automating science is the long-term mission.” #Startups #FutureofWork

---
Post 5: 🧪 "MD and DFT are overrated." Andrew isn't shy about calling out established methods. The focus is shifting to AI-driven approaches, but the limitations of current systems are also becoming clearer. “I think we're at the point where we're trying to find problems that are hard but not impossible." #AIforScience

---
Post 6: 🤯 The "Cosmos" project highlights a crucial insight: AI isn’t just about *solving* problems, it’s about *interpreting* the solutions. "Humans have a very like well-calibrated nose for science."  It’s the taste, not just the calculation, that drives progress. #AIethics #ScientificDiscovery

---
Post 7: 🚀 Andrew’s vision: AI as a collaborator, not a replacement, in scientific discovery. But is the relentless pursuit of automation truly aligned with the human quest for understanding? What happens when AI generates insights we *can’t* comprehend? 🤔 #FutureofScience #AIrisk

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A hyperrealistic, slightly surreal digital painting depicting a complex molecular structure intertwined with glowing circuit boards and neural network connections. A single, stylized human eye observes the scene with a look of both awe and cautious contemplation. The color palette should be a blend of cool blues and vibrant greens, evoking a sense of both technological advancement and the mysteries of the natural world. Style: Cyberpunk meets scientific illustration. Aspect Ratio: 16:9
