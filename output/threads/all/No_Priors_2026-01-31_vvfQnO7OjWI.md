# How Until is Engineering Away Time in Organ Transplants | Laura Deming (2026-01-31)

Post 1: 🤯 Imagine a future where someone on death's door can be "paused" until a cure arrives. Sounds like sci-fi? Not anymore. Laura Deming, founder of Longevity Fund & CEO of Until, is making it a reality. ⏳ What does this mean for medicine, aging, & humanity? 👇 #cryopreservation #longevity #futuretech

Post 2: Until's goal: reversible whole-body cryopreservation for medical hibernation. 🧊 But first, they're tackling organ preservation to revolutionize transplants. "Making time not a variable changes the whole paradigm." - Laura Deming. Game-changing. #organTransplant #medicalInnovation

Post 3: The core challenge? Ice formation! 🥶 "Water expands when it forms ice. That's just hard for your tissue to take without substantial damage." Deming's team is finding ways to bypass this, building on existing cryopreservation tech used for embryos (preserved for 30+ years!). #scienceFacts

Post 4: "The main question isn't *if* this is possible, but *how* to scale it up." 🚀 Deming highlights a social blind spot in longevity research, arguing that it’s often overlooked despite incredible potential. A huge opportunity for innovation! #aging #research #opportunity

Post 5: Deming's journey is fascinating: from wanting telepathy as a kid to founding a longevity fund, now spearheading Until. 👧➡️🔬 She noticed a gap: "Most people would say… the big problem is we just can’t get enough funding.” So she *created* the funding. #entrepreneurship #visionary

Post 6: Beyond medical use, Deming acknowledges the allure of "skipping time" (think Mars travel). But she emphasizes a crucial point: "It's the social context that matters." 🫂 Leaving loved ones behind is a significant hurdle. #future #ethics #technology

Post 7: Until is engineering away time, tackling a problem previously confined to science fiction. ⏳ This isn't just about extending life; it's about redefining what's possible. What ethical considerations arise as we gain control over time itself? 🤔 #futureofmedicine #thoughtleadership
