Here's a Twitter thread breakdown of the interview transcript, designed for high engagement and virality:

**Post 1: (Hook)** 🤯 Is *everything* just a sophisticated algorithm? This interview with a leading AI researcher challenges our very definition of agency, intelligence, and even... rocks. Buckle up, because this is a deep dive into the future of AI and what it means to be *real*. 🧵 #AI #DeepLearning #Philosophy #Agency

**Post 2:** 🧱 The core idea: Geometric Deep Learning isn't just about *modeling* the physical world, it's about *incorporating* its inherent symmetries. "It’s like we're highly motivated to employ a lot of those methods & techniques." This changes everything. #GeometricDL #Physics #AI

---
**Post 3:** 🤯 "An agent is just a really sophisticated object." – The interviewee. Seriously. No structural difference between a rock and you, just *degrees* of complexity. It's a radical re-framing of agency.  Is that unsettling or liberating? 🤔 #Agent #Object #AIPhilosophy

---
**Post 4:** 🧪  Energy-Based Models (EBMs) are key to this. They add an "inductive prior" – constraints – to AI learning. "An energy based model comes with something that's kind of like an inductive prior." Think of it as building AI that *understands* the rules of the game. #EBM #MachineLearning #AI

---
**Post 5:** 🔬 "If you can show that it's engaged in planning & counterfactual reasoning, then it’s definitely an agent.” But... can we *actually* tell?  External observation only reveals the "policy," not the internal processes. The black box problem, amplified. #Planning #Counterfactual #AIexplainability

---
**Post 6:** 🚨 The biggest risk? AI making us *dumber*. "Offloading your thinking... is potentially a big problem." We need AI to enhance, not replace, human intellect.  The reward function needs careful design: "perturb that distribution [of outcomes] a little bit.” #AIethics #Cognition #FutureofWork

---
**Post 7: (Alpha Take & CTA)** The future isn't about AGI, but "collective specialized intelligences."  The real breakthrough? AI that helps us *understand* the world better, not just automate it. What does a world powered by truly intelligent systems look like? Share your thoughts! 👇 #AISafety #TechOptimism #Future
