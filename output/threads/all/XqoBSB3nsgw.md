Here's a X (Twitter) thread based on the interview transcript, designed for high engagement and virality.

**Post 1: [Hook]**
🤯 Protein folding solved... on your desktop?! The story behind AlphaFold isn't what you think. A massive, multi-billion dollar effort was *almost* the solution, but a desktop app changed everything. This is a history lesson in AI, science, and the unexpected. 🧵 #AI #Science #ProteinFolding #AlphaFold

**Post 2:**
🤯 The "almost" solution: Desha Research. They built custom silicon, massive clusters, and dedicated algorithms to crack protein folding. David Shaw (Shaw & Co.) even flew in by helicopter to showcase their progress! 🚁 It was thought to require specialized, government-funded machines. #DeepMind #Research

**Post 3:**
💥 The Shock: AlphaFold arrived & ran on a GPU! Andrew White (Future House, Edison Scientific) says: "It was so mind-blowing. I forget that protein folding was solved. The fact that it was solved and on like your desktop… it was just completely floored." 🤯 #MachineLearning #Innovation

**Post 4:**
🔬 AI & Science - a growing divide. "These are two communities which have been developed independently… only now after many years are we starting to see some of the big developments start to play out." Bridging that gap is crucial. #AIScience #Collaboration

**Post 5:**
🔑 Key Takeaways from Andrew White:
*   MD & DFT (traditional simulation methods) are often overhyped.
*   "Simulations simulate boring things really well. They don't simulate interesting things very well.”
*   Automating science is about *connecting* existing data, not just inventing new models. #Science #DataScience

**Post 6:**
🚨 The "Taste" Problem: Even the smartest AI needs human guidance. Andrew: "Humans have a very well-calibrated nose for science."  The challenge? Defining & integrating that "taste" into AI workflows.  Is human intuition the last frontier? #AIethics #HumanIntelligence #ScientificDiscovery

**Post 7: [Alpha Take & Call to Action]**
🚀 The future isn't just about *doing* science, but *directing* it. Are we ready to shift from being experimenters to AI wranglers? What overlooked datasets or scientific domains are ripe for AI disruption? Share your thoughts! 👇 #FutureofScience #AIRevolution
