Okay, here's a X (Twitter) thread designed to generate engagement based on the provided transcript, following all your instructions. I've identified the core breakthrough as the standardization of "Skills" for AI agents – a huge deal for interoperability and rapid knowledge injection.

**Post 1: [Hook]**

🤯 Agents are evolving *fast*. Forget endless training. Imagine plugging in "skills" – like giving your AI a specialized textbook on demand. This changes everything. Is this the end of massive AI training datasets? ➡️ [Link to course/info] #AI #AgentAI #Skills #Anthropic #FutureofWork

**Post 2: What are "Skills"?**

"Skills are a new way to equip Claude code and other agents with on-demand knowledge." Think of them as modular, reusable expertise. 🧩 No more rebuilding the wheel! They’re a standardized format of instructions, scripts, & references. #AIdevelopment #AgentArchitecture

**Post 3: How do Skills work?**

It's brilliantly simple:
*   You create/download a "skill" folder (think: a mini-knowledge base).
*   The agent *dynamically* loads it when needed.
*   "For example, maybe one skill will contain a checklist of code quality criteria..." 🤯 #AIworkflows #KnowledgeManagement

**Post 4: The Interoperability Angle**

This is HUGE: "Because the format is standardized, you can use the same skills with *any* other compatible agent." 🤝 Agent ecosystems are about to explode with reusability and collaboration.  Goodbye vendor lock-in? #OpenSourceAI #AgentEcosystem #Innovation

**Post 5: Real-World Applications (as mentioned in the transcript)**

Skills aren't just theoretical.  We're talking:
*   Code review checklists
*   SQL query generation
*   Customer data analysis workflows
*   And so much more! 🚀  #AIusecases #DataAnalysis #Coding

**Post 6: Beyond the Basics – Composing Skills**

"You'll learn how to combine skills with other parts of your agent stack..." 🤯  Imagine orchestrating complex tasks by chaining together specialized skills. The possibilities are endless.  #AgentOrchestration #AISystems #MCP
