# 🔬 Automating Science: World Models, Scientific Taste, Agent Loops — Andrew White (2026-02-01)

Post 1: 🤯 Protein folding solved... not with supercomputers, but on your desktop?! Andrew White just dropped a truth bomb about AI & science. Forget what you *think* you know about scientific breakthroughs. This is a game changer. 🧵👇 #AI #Science #Innovation #FutureofWork

Post 2: The Desha Research story is WILD. They poured massive funding & built custom silicon to crack protein folding with brute force. AlphaFold did it on a GPU. 🤯 "I always thought that protein folding would be solved by them, but it would require a special machine." #DeepMind #AlphaFold

Post 3: Andrew's key takeaway: "There's no one-size-fits-all solution. You need domain expertise & AI engineers working *together*." It's not just about the tech; it’s about bridging the gap between theory & practice. 🤝 #AIforScience #Collaboration

---
Post 4: 🧪 Automating science isn't just about building faster machines. It’s about automating *thinking*. Andrew’s startup, Edison Scientific, is focused on creating AI agents that generate hypotheses, design experiments, & analyze results – all autonomously. #AgentAI #ScientificDiscovery

---
Post 5: 🤯 "The bottleneck isn't always compute power, but understanding the *context* of data." It’s not enough to just crunch numbers. You need to interpret results & connect them to the real world. Human expertise is still crucial. #DataScience #CriticalThinking

Post 6: 🧪 "We thought we were building AI scientists, but they ended up teaching us more than we taught them." Andrew's team's experiments with Cosmos revealed unexpected biases & the surprising importance of "scientific taste" - what makes a hypothesis *truly* interesting. #MachineLearning #Bias #Innovation

---
Post 7: The future of science isn't just about *doing* more, it's about *asking better questions*. Can AI truly unlock scientific breakthroughs, or will it just amplify existing biases? What role will humans play in a world of automated discovery? 🤔 #AIethics #FutureofScience

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized, futuristic laboratory scene. A holographic projection of a protein folding structure overlays a complex network of interconnected nodes representing AI agents. The color palette is cool blues and greens, with subtle hints of gold to represent the transformative power of the technology. The overall aesthetic should be both awe-inspiring and slightly unsettling, hinting at the profound changes AI is bringing to science.
