Here's a Twitter thread based on the interview transcript, designed for high engagement and virality:

**Post 1: [Hook]**

🤯 Imagine pausing time for someone facing death, buying them years until a cure arrives. Sounds like sci-fi? Scientists are actively working on it. This interview reveals the surprisingly grounded science behind "medical hibernation." ⏳ #longevity #cryopreservation #futuretech

**Post 2: [The Goal - Beyond Just Organs]**

Laura Deming (Until) isn't just about preserving organs (though that's a key near-term goal). The *long-term* vision? Reversible whole-body cryopreservation – essentially, putting humans on medical pause. ⏸️ It's a paradigm shift. #medicalinnovation #science

**Post 3: [The Science - Avoiding Ice is Key]**

"Ice formation is a stochastic process." 🤯 Deming explains the core challenge: water expands when it freezes, destroying tissue. The breakthrough? There's a temperature *below* which ice formation stops. It’s all about traversing that zone without damage. #biotech #nanotech

**Post 4: [The Surprising Reality - We're Already Doing This!]**

You'd think this was decades away. Nope! "We already reversibly cry preserve tissue, including human tissue… kids have been cryopreserved as embryos for 30 years!" The question isn’t *if* it’s possible, but *how do we scale it up?* 🚀 #futureisnow #medicalbreakthrough

**Post 5: [Why Isn't This Mainstream? - A Social Blind Spot]**

Why hasn't this been a bigger focus? Deming argues it's a "social blind spot." Aging isn’t neatly categorized as a disease, hindering funding & research. "It's not seen as valid to work on…for classification reasons." 🤔 #aging #research #funding

**Post 6: [The "Coolest" Problem & Hunter's Insight]**

Deming calls cryopreservation "the coolest, most interesting problem ever." Her co-founder, Hunter, initially doubted it, then ran the math & realized: "Wait, this seems like actually feasible in a way that is very different from my initial intuition." 🧠 #teamwork #science

**Post 7: [Alpha Take & Question]**

The implications are staggering. "Making time not a variable changes the whole paradigm." ⏳ Is this the future of healthcare? What ethical considerations arise when we can essentially "pause" life? Let's discuss! 👇 #futureofmedicine #bioethics #longevity
