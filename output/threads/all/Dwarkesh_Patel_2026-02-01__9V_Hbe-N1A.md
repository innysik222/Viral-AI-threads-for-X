# Adam Marblestone – AI is missing something fundamental about the brain (2026-02-01)

Post 1: 🤯 AI isn’t just lacking data—it's missing a *fundamental* understanding of how the brain actually *works*. Adam Marblestone argues we're chasing the wrong approach. Is neuroscience the key to unlocking true AI? 🧠🧵 #AI #Neuroscience #AGI

Post 2: Marblestone: "We’re throwing way more data at LLMs, and they *still* have a small fraction of the capabilities of a human." It's not just about scale; it’s about a deeper architectural and algorithmic flaw. 🤯 #AIlimitations #BrainVsAI

Post 3: The missing piece? Loss functions. 📉 "Evolution may have built a *lot* of complexity into the loss functions... many different loss functions for different areas turned on at different stages of development." LLMs use simple math – brains don't. #LossFunctions #EvolutionaryAI

Post 4: Marblestone proposes we need to empower neuroscience: "to actually be able to crack a question like this." It’s not just about *more* data, it's about a fundamentally *different* research paradigm. 🔬 #Neuroscience #Research

Post 5: 🤯 His hunch: Cortex might be a "general prediction engine" – predicting *any* pattern from *any* subset of inputs. Think omnidirectional inference, not just next-token prediction. This is a radical shift in how we think about AI architecture! #OmnidirectionalInference #AIArchitecture

Post 6: The "Steering Subsystem" (innate reflexes) & the "Learning Subsystem" (cortex) – a powerful framework for understanding how brains learn.  Marblestone argues evolution wired these systems to work *together*, and AI needs to emulate that. 🧠➡️🤖 #BrainArchitecture #Evolution

---
Post 7: Alpha Take: We're focusing on *what* AI can do, not *how* it learns. Marblestone's insights suggest a profound shift is needed – a deeper understanding of the brain’s fundamental learning mechanisms. What if true AGI requires a neuroscientific revolution? 🤔 #AGI #FutureofAI

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A hyperrealistic, bioluminescent depiction of a human brain intertwined with a complex neural network circuit board, with fractal patterns emerging from the intersection. The background is a nebula of data streams and mathematical equations. Style: Art Deco meets futuristic sci-fi. Color Palette: Deep blues, emerald greens, and shimmering golds. Aspect Ratio: 16:9.
