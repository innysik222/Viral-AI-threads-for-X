# 🔬 Automating Science: World Models, Scientific Taste, Agent Loops — Andrew White (2026-01-31)

Post 1: 🤯 Forget protein folding breakthroughs. The *real* mind-blower? Scientists built a custom, multi-million dollar machine to do it… only for it to be solved on your desktop. Andrew White just dropped some serious truth bombs about AI, science, & the future. 🧵 Show more!

Post 2: "They tested the hypothesis to death...built their own silicon, clusters, algorithms, the whole nine yards." Desha Research's failed protein folding machine highlights a crucial point: brute force isn't always the answer. Sometimes, the smartest tool is already in your pocket. 🤯

Post 3: Andrew White's journey from academia (molecular dynamics!) to launching two startups (Future House & Edison Scientific) is wild. He realized, "I was only one working on computers in this group. I couldn’t figure out how to connect what's on the computer with what's done in the lab." 🤯 #AI #Science

Post 4: 🔑 The core mission: Automating Science. Not just modeling, but the *entire* scientific process – hypothesis generation, experimentation, analysis. "We want to automate the cognitive process of scientific discovery." 🚀 #AIScience #Automation

---
Post 5: "We’re getting to 60% 70% correctness on BigBench…and humans disagree 70% of the time." 🤯  AI isn't replacing scientists, it's augmenting them.  The future isn't about AI *doing* science, but AI & humans *collaborating* to accelerate discovery. #AICollaboration

---
Post 6: 🧪 "The frontier right now is scientific taste." AI can generate data & models, but understanding *what* data is valuable, what experiments are worth pursuing - that's where human expertise (and AI learning from humans!) truly shines. #ScientificTaste #AI

---
Post 7: Alpha Take: The shift from brute force hardware to AI-powered workflows is a paradigm shift. Are we truly prepared for the exponential acceleration of scientific discovery that’s coming? What skills will the scientists of the future *really* need? 🤔 #AIScience #FutureofWork
