Post 3: 🗣️ “When that arrow passes through your body, you'll only have a moment to realize it before you fall over." - Paul Rosolie. The risk is real. These tribes defend their territory fiercely, reacting violently to outsiders. 💥 #Danger #Amazon

Post 4: 🤯 The encounter wasn't a friendly greeting. The tribe approached with 7-foot bows, pointing & communicating amongst themselves. Romel, an anthropologist, attempted communication, but tension was palpable. 😬 #FirstContact #Tribe

Post 5: 🌿 What’s their worldview? They see outsiders as destroyers of their world. They’re witnessing deforestation & resource exploitation firsthand. Protecting the rainforest isn't just about ecology; it's about protecting a culture. #IndigenousRights #Conservation
