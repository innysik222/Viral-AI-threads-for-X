# How Until is Engineering Away Time in Organ Transplants | Laura Deming (2026-02-01)

Post 1: 🤯 Imagine putting a loved one on pause, waiting for a cure. Sounds like sci-fi? Laura Deming, founder of Longevity Fund & CEO of Until, is *actually* engineering this. This interview is wild. 🧵 #longevity #cryopreservation #futuretech

Post 2: Until's goal? Reversible whole-body cryopreservation. But first: cryopreserving *organs* to revolutionize transplants. “Making time not a variable changes the whole paradigm.” ⏳ Huge implications for patients & medical research. #medicalinnovation #organfailure

Post 3: The core challenge? Ice formation. 🧊 "Water expands when it forms ice… That’s just hard for your tissue to take without substantial damage." Deming explains how they're working *below* a critical temperature to avoid this. It’s surprisingly further along than you'd think! #sciencefacts #tissueengineering

Post 4: 🤯 Did you know human embryos have been cryopreserved for *30 years*?  "The main question isn't *is this possible*, it’s *is it possible to scale up*."  The technical hurdles are immense, but the groundwork is surprisingly solid. #bioengineering #humanpreservation

Post 5: Deming’s background is fascinating. Homeschooled in New Zealand, she literally pondered the mortality of sheep & concluded, "everyone should live until 10 & then die immediately." 🐑 A pivotal moment that sparked a lifelong obsession with longevity. #unconventionalthinking #lifespan

Post 6:  "We can trade off engineering difficulty & biological difficulty to a non-zero degree."  That's key. Engineering isn't a *replacement* for biological understanding, but a powerful lever to solve previously intractable problems. 🚀 #innovation #problemSolving

---
Post 7:  Engineering away time isn't just about extending life; it's about fundamentally changing how we experience it. What ethical and societal shifts would occur if "pausing" became a reality? 🤔  What other "impossible" problems should we be tackling? #futureofhumanity #bioethics

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT:  A surreal, hyperrealistic digital painting. A single, glowing human heart suspended within a swirling vortex of blue and white cryogenic mist.  The background is a blurred cityscape, suggesting a futuristic medical facility.  Style:  A blend of scientific illustration and dreamlike fantasy, with a focus on intricate detail and a sense of wonder and potential. Color palette: Primarily cool blues, whites, and subtle hints of iridescent gold.  Aspect Ratio: 16:9 for Twitter.
