# If You Can't See Inside, How Do You Know It's THINKING? [Dr. Jeff Beck] (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 Is *anything* truly an agent? Dr. Jeff Beck just dropped a bomb: even a rock, according to a strict definition, *could* be an agent. 🤯 Here's why this challenges our understanding of AI, consciousness, & what it means to "think." 🧵👇 #AI #philosophy #consciousness #deeplearning

Post 2: Beck argues geometric deep learning is crucial for modeling the physical world – incorporating its symmetries. It’s not about “writing code,” but exploiting the *regularities* already built-in. "The world is translation invariant…rotationally invariant..." 🤯 #physics #AIresearch

Post 3: 🤯 The agency debate: Beck, a "FEP purist," says there's no *structural* difference between an agent and an object. It's a matter of "degrees." A sophisticated object *is* an agent. But how do we *know*? "If you can't look inside...can you conclude something's an agent?" 🤔 #agency #AIethics

Post 4: 🔑Defining an agent: It's not about intentionality or self-causation (philosophical notions). It's about "a thing which acts & performs some kind of computation." Even a rock, if viewed as an input-output relationship, *could* technically be an agent. Wild. 🤯 #computationaltheory #philosophyofmind

Post 5: How to spot a true agent? Not just complex policies! It's about "planning, counterfactual reasoning, goal-oriented behavior." These are latent variables tied to reinforcement learning. But even *that* can be modeled without actually doing it. 🧐 #reinforcementlearning #AI

Post 6: 🚨 The danger: We risk mistaking complex function transformations for genuine agency. Beck stresses we need to "crack it open & see what's going on inside." Otherwise, we're just building increasingly sophisticated black boxes. ⚠️ #AIsafety #transparency

Post 7: Alpha Take: The line between object & agent is blurring. Understanding *how* an AI arrives at a decision (not just *what* decision it makes) is critical. Are we building tools or mimicking consciousness? Let's demand transparency & focus on *understanding* AI, not just deploying it. 🚀 #futureofAI

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized, hyperrealistic depiction of a smooth, gray river stone resting on a complex circuit board, glowing with subtle, internal light. The stone appears to be subtly "thinking," with faint, fractal patterns radiating outwards. Background is a dark, abstract representation of a neural network architecture. The overall tone is mysterious and slightly unsettling, suggesting hidden complexity. Use a cinematic lighting style, inspired by Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner."
