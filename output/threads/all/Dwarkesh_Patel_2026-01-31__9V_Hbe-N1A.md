# Adam Marblestone – AI is missing something fundamental about the brain (2026-01-31)

Post 1: 🤯 AI is *still* orders of magnitude behind the human brain. What crucial ingredient are we missing? Adam Marblestone argues it's not just data, but a fundamental misunderstanding of how the brain learns. This is a quadrillion-dollar question. 🧵 #AI #Neuroscience #Brain

Post 2: Marblestone isn't saying we need more data. He's saying we need to empower neuroscience to unlock the brain’s secrets. "Maybe the way that we would think about this now, with modern AI... is that there are certain key components that we’re neglecting." 🧠 #AGI #DeepLearning

Post 3: The key? It’s not just architecture or learning algorithms. It's *loss functions*. 🤯 "Evolution may have built a lot of complexity into the loss functions...many different loss functions for different areas turned on at different stages of development." #MachineLearning

---
Post 4:  “LLMs are just predicting the next token.” But what if the brain is doing something far more complex? Marblestone posits "omnidirectional inference" - predicting *any* subset of variables from *any* other subset.  🤯 A radically different approach. #ProbabilisticAI

---
Post 5:  He draws parallels to Yann LeCun's energy-based models, suggesting a move beyond simple loss functions. "The cortex is just trying to predict... Basically can it learn to predict any subset of all the variables it sees from any other subset?" 🤯 #NeuralNetworks

---
Post 6:  This isn't just about AI; it's about understanding ourselves.  Marblestone highlights Steve Byrnes' work on the “Steering Subsystem” – innate reflexes & instincts guiding learning. Our social interactions, even fear of Yann LeCun, are driven by it. 😅 #CognitiveScience

---
Post 7:  Alpha Take: We're fixated on scaling LLMs, but true AGI might require a paradigm shift – embracing the brain’s complexity, not just mimicking its architecture. Are we building the right tools to understand the *loss functions* of the brain? 🤔 #FutureofAI
