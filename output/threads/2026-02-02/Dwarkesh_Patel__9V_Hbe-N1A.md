# Adam Marblestone – AI is missing something fundamental about the brain (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 AI isn't just lacking data – it's missing a *fundamental* understanding of how the brain *actually* works. Neuroscientist Adam Marblestone argues current AI approaches are missing a key piece of the puzzle. Is this the quadrillion-dollar question? ➡️ [Thread] #AI #Neuroscience #Brain #AGI

Post 2: Marblestone’s core argument: LLMs are powerful, but they're vastly underperforming compared to the human brain. The issue isn't *more* data, it's a deeper architectural and algorithmic misunderstanding. 🤔 #AIlimitations #BrainVsAI

Post 3: 🧠 The crucial missing ingredient? Specific "loss functions" - the reward signals driving learning. Evolution, he argues, has built incredibly complex ones, far beyond simple "predict the next token" approaches. “Evolution may have built a lot of complexity into the loss functions...” #Evolution #Learning

Post 4: 🤯 "The cortex is just predicting... omnidirectionally." It's not just predicting the *next* token, but any subset of variables from any other subset. This "probabilistic AI" approach contrasts sharply with current LLM architectures. Dialogue Reconstruction: "Can it learn to predict any subset of all the variables it sees..." #ProbabilisticAI #Cortex

Post 5: 🧬 Marblestone highlights the importance of neuroscience. "We have to empower the field of neuroscience to just make neuroscience a more powerful field technologically." The answer to unlocking AI's true potential may lie not in computer science, but in understanding the brain itself. #Neuroscience #AIresearch

Post 6: 💡Key Takeaways:
* LLMs are missing complex, evolutionary-designed "loss functions."
* The cortex excels at "omnidirectional prediction."
* Neuroscience, not just AI, holds the key to unlocking AGI.
* We need to rethink how AI learns - maybe it's about modeling the "Steering Subsystem" of the brain. #AGI #FutureofAI

Post 7: Alpha Take: Marblestone’s perspective is a powerful reminder that we might be looking in the wrong places. The next generation of AI breakthroughs may require a paradigm shift, embracing the complexity and elegance of the biological brain. What if the biggest AI advancements come *from* neuroscience? 💭 #AIphilosophy #BrainInspiredAI

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A surreal, hyperrealistic digital painting depicting a stylized human brain intertwined with intricate neural network circuitry. The brain glows with bioluminescent energy, while abstract mathematical equations and code fragments float around it. The overall aesthetic should be both futuristic and organic, conveying the idea of bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence. Use a color palette of deep blues, purples, and vibrant greens. Style: Art Deco meets Cyberpunk. Aspect Ratio: 16:9.
