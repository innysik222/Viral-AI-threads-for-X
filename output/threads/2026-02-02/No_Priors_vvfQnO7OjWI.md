# How Until is Engineering Away Time in Organ Transplants | Laura Deming (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 What if we could *pause* someone's life while we find a cure? Laura Deming, founder of Longevity Fund & CEO of Until, is engineering away time – first for organs, then *humans*. Sounds like sci-fi, but the science is surprisingly close. ➡️ Show more #longevity #cryopreservation #futureofmedicine

Post 2: Deming's company, Until, is tackling reversible cryopreservation - essentially, putting organs (and eventually, whole bodies) into a suspended state. The goal? To buy time for medical breakthroughs. ⏳ "Making time not a variable changes the whole paradigm." #medicalinnovation #futuretech

Post 3: 🧊 The biggest hurdle? Ice crystal formation. "Water expands when it forms ice. That’s just hard for your tissue to take without substantial damage." BUT – there's a temperature below which ice formation *stops*. They're already cryopreserving human tissue for decades! #sciencefacts #bioengineering

Post 4: It’s not about *if* it’s possible, but *how* to scale it.  Deming: "The main question is not is this possible to do at all. It's is it possible to scale up."  🤯  She's obsessed with areas that *should* be worked on but aren't - finding those "social blind spots" is key. #innovation #problemSolving

Post 5:  "We already reversibly cry preserve tissue...including human tissue...for very long time periods. There are kids who were literally cryerved for 30 years as tiny embryos." 🤯 This isn't a theoretical future; it's a foundation built on decades of research. #medicalhistory #embryology

Post 6:  Beyond organ transplants, Deming envisions a future where time itself becomes a resource.  “What if you could take someone who is on their deathbed and find some way to hibernate them until the sort of critical cure for their disease comes online?” A radical shift in how we approach mortality. #futureofhealthcare #bioethics

Post 7: Until's work isn't just about extending life; it's about fundamentally redefining our relationship with time. A bold vision, and a glimpse into a future where medical limitations are challenged. What ethical considerations arise as we engineer time itself? 🤔 #thoughtleadership #futureisnow

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A hyperrealistic digital painting depicting a luminous, crystalline sphere containing a human organ suspended in a swirling, ethereal blue mist. The background is a futuristic, sterile medical laboratory with subtle holographic projections of molecular structures. The overall tone is hopeful, advanced, and slightly surreal.  Style: photorealistic, cinematic lighting, 8k resolution, trending on ArtStation.
