# If You Can't See Inside, How Do You Know It's THINKING? [Dr. Jeff Beck] (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 Is a rock an "agent"? Dr. Jeff Beck just dropped a truth bomb that's shattering our assumptions about AI, agency, & what it *really* means for something to be "thinking." Prepare to question everything. 🧵 Show more 👇

Post 2: Beck argues that "an agent is a really sophisticated object." It’s not about consciousness or intentionality, but about the *complexity* of its policy. "If your definition of an agent is something that executes a policy, then anything is an agent." 🤯 #AI #Agency #DeepLearning

Post 3: 🤯 "From an outside perspective, if you can't look at how someone or something is doing the computations…does that mean you can never conclude that something’s an agent?" Beck’s answer? NO. We can still infer agency based on observed behavior. #AIethics #Philosophy

Post 4: 🔑Geometric deep learning is key to modeling the physical world – incorporating symmetries like rotation & translation. Beck: "The mathematician in me really wants to build the symmetries in.” This isn't just about code; it's about reflecting the *structure* of reality. #Physics #Math

Post 5:  Beck dismantles the "philosophical highbrow notion of agency."  It boils down to "it’s just a thing which acts and performs some kind of computation."  Agency isn't some mystical quality; it's a matter of degrees of sophistication.  #AIphilosophy #ComputationalTheory

Post 6: 🚨 The biggest danger?  AI making us *dumb*.  "Offloading your thinking onto a machine...is a potentially a big problem." True intelligence isn't just about prediction; it’s about expanding our understanding of the world. Let's build AI to *augment*, not replace, us. #AIrisk #Humanity

Post 7: Alpha Take: Beck's insights force us to re-evaluate what we *mean* by "agency."  It's not about feeling or consciousness, but complexity & the ability to adapt. What kind of future do we want to build – one where AI amplifies human potential, or one where we become passive observers? 🤔 #AIfuture

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A surreal, hyperrealistic depiction of a smooth, grey river stone overlaid with a complex network of glowing, interconnected nodes and lines representing neural pathways. The background is a swirling vortex of code and mathematical symbols. The overall aesthetic should be both elegant and slightly unsettling, conveying the idea of hidden intelligence within an unassuming object. Use a color palette of cool blues, greens, and silver. Style: Art Deco meets Cyberpunk.
