# 🔬 From Red Teaming GPT-4 to Automating Drug Discovery: The Future of AI in Science — Andrew White (2026-02-02)

Post 1: 🤯 Forget everything you think you know about scientific breakthroughs. This interview reveals how AI is *radically* reshaping research, and it’s not what you expect. A massive counter-example to traditional thinking… Prepare to have your assumptions challenged. ➡️ #AI #Science #Innovation

---
Post 2: The "counterfactual" story is wild. Desha Research, *more* funded than DeepMind, poured resources into MD (Molecular Dynamics) protein folding…built custom silicon, the works! 🤯 Thought they’d crack it with brute force. AlphaFold changed *everything*. #ProteinFolding #AI

---
Post 3: 🗣️ Andrew White: “AlphaFold came out, and it’s like you can do it in Google Collab, you know, or on a GPU or desktop, it was so mind-blowing. I forget like that protein folding was solved. I always thought that was inevitable..." The democratization of scientific power. #AlphaFold #AIinScience

Post 4: 🔑 Key Takeaway: It's not about raw compute anymore. It's about *how* you combine AI engineers & scientists. "There's no one-size-fits-all solution. You need domain expertise...people who can really talk to each other." Collaboration is the new frontier. #AIcollaboration #Science

---
Post 5: 🧪 Automating science isn’t just about robots in labs. It's about AI guiding the *cognitive process* – hypothesis generation, experiment design, analysis. "Automating science is the goal."  Future House & Edison Scientific are pushing this boundary. #AutomatedScience #FutureofWork

---
Post 6: 🚨 Biggest risk?  AI isn’t just accelerating discovery; it’s potentially amplifying existing biases.  “There's a lot of stuff that's just too farfetched to consider.”  We need critical oversight & responsible AI development in science. #AIRisk #ResponsibleAI

---
Post 7:  Alpha Take: The shift from brute force computation to AI-guided discovery isn’t just a technological leap; it’s a philosophical one. Are *we* the bottleneck now? What new frontiers will AI unlock, and what ethical guardrails do we need to build? 🤔 #AIethics #ScienceFuture

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized, futuristic laboratory scene. A holographic projection of a complex protein structure is overlaid on a workbench, with intricate neural network diagrams subtly interwoven. The overall aesthetic is clean, minimalist, and evokes a sense of both scientific discovery and underlying complexity. The color palette should be cool blues and greens with accents of vibrant orange highlighting the AI elements.  Art style: a blend of photorealism and digital illustration, reminiscent of a concept art piece for a sci-fi film.
