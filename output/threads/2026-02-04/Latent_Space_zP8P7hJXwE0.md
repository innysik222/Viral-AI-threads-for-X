# ⚡️ Context graphs: AI’s trillion-dollar opportunity — Jaya Gupta, Ashu Garg, Foundation Capital (2026-02-04)

Post 1: 🤯 Forget agents. Forget LLMs. The *real* trillion-dollar opportunity in AI isn't what you think. It’s "Context Graphs." What are they, why are they crucial, and why incumbents are about to get left behind. 🧵👇 #AI #ContextGraphs #FutureofAI

Post 2: "Everyone said 2025 would be the year of agents…but they still can’t reliably do enterprise work." - Jaya Gupta. The problem? Agents lack context. They don't understand *why* decisions are made. Enter: Context Graphs. 📈 #AIagents #EnterpriseAI

Post 3: So, what *is* a Context Graph? It's the institutional memory of *why* decisions happen. Think: why exceptions are granted, how conflicts are resolved, precedents applied. It's a collection of "decision traces" - the sequence of actions leading to a result. 🧠 #DecisionMaking #AIArchitecture

Post 4: Ashu Garg (Foundation Capital) highlights a critical shift: the IP is moving *out* of the models & into systems that *manage* them.  "The enduring layer for the most successful application companies will be the accumulation of decision traces." 🤯 #AIstrategy #SystemsOfAgents

Post 5: 🚨 Here's the kicker: Incumbents *can't* easily build Context Graphs. They're bound by existing data structures & processes.  New, nimble AI companies, like @playerzero.ai & @OliveAI, have a huge advantage.  A new era of applied AI is dawning. 🚀 #AIinnovation #Disruption

Post 6: "Don't think of context graphs as a technology architecture, think of it as a framework." - J. Gupta. It's not a single product, but an approach. Expect to see diverse implementations (graph databases, data fabrics) as companies race to build them.  It’s a Cambrian explosion of opportunity. 💥 #AIinfrastructure #DataFabric

Post 7: Alpha Take: Context Graphs are the *infrastructure* for the next generation of AI. This isn't just about building better agents; it’s about capturing and leveraging organizational knowledge. What context are *you* capturing? 🤔 #AIinsights #FutureofWork

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized, futuristic network diagram visually representing interconnected nodes (representing decisions and data points) swirling around a central, glowing core labeled "Context Graph." The background is a dark, abstract cityscape, hinting at the scale and impact of this technology on the future of enterprise. The color palette should be cool blues and greens with vibrant accents of orange and yellow to symbolize innovation and insight. Style: Clean, minimalist, high-tech.
