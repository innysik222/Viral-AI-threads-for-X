# Goodfire AI’s Bet: Interpretability as the Next Frontier of Model Design — Myra Deng & Mark Bissell (2026-02-06)

Post 1: 🤯 AI isn't just about *building* bigger models. It's about *understanding* them. Goodfire AI is betting big that "interpretability" is the key to unlocking the next generation of powerful *and* safe AI. Series B funding secured, valuation hits $1.25B – what are they onto? 🧵 #AI #Interpretability #DeepLearning

Post 2: Goodfire isn’t just researching interpretability—they’re building *tools* to use it. They see it as "the science of deep learning," going beyond black-box approaches to understand internal representations & even integrate interpretability *into* training itself. 🤯 #AIresearch

Post 3: 🗣️ "We're an AI research lab that focuses on using interpretability to understand, learn from, and design AI models... interpretability will unlock the new generation, next frontier of safe and powerful AI models." – Myra Deng. This isn’t just about debugging; it’s about *intentional design*. #AIdevelopment

Post 4: The "40 Glazegate" controversy? Goodfire believes interpretability could have prevented it. 🚨 They're focusing on "surgical edits" – removing biases, correcting behavior – instead of relying on post-hoc fixes. The future of AI safety might depend on it. #AISafety

Post 5: 🤯 The most mind-blowing insight: Interpretability isn't just about *what* a model knows, but *how* it knows it. They’re exploring "belief dynamics" – understanding the model’s *reasoning process*—to identify & correct flawed logic. Think of it as AI cognitive neuroscience. #MachineLearning

Post 6: 🤝 Goodfire's working with industry giants like Rakuten, using interpretability to guardrail inference & detect PII. They’re also pioneering techniques to “steer” models, like subtly adjusting internal features to change their behavior. The future is about *control*. #AIapplications

---
Post 7: Alpha Take: Interpretability is moving from a research niche to a critical engineering discipline. It's not just about understanding *what* AI does, but *how* to guide its evolution. Are we ready to build AI we *understand*? What does that mean for the future of innovation? 🤔 #FutureofAI

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A futuristic, stylized neural network diagram overlaid with glowing, translucent pathways representing interpretability. A single, brightly lit "node" in the network is being examined by a robotic hand holding a magnifying glass. The color palette is cool blues and purples, with a subtle sense of depth and complexity. Style: Clean, modern, sci-fi aesthetic. Ratio: 16:9.
