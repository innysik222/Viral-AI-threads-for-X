# How Elon plans to launch a terawatt of GPUs into space (2026-02-06)

Post 1: 🤯 Elon just revealed humanity's energy future hinges on launching GPUs into SPACE. Seriously. He believes Earth can’t keep up with AI’s power demands. Is this a bold vision or a looming crisis? 🧵 Show more! #AI #Space #ElonMusk #EnergyCrisis

Post 2: ⚡️The Problem: Earth's electrical output is flatlining. China’s booming, but everywhere else, it’s struggling to meet the exponentially growing demand of AI. Elon: "The output of chips is growing pretty much exponentially, but the output of electricity is flat." #AIInfrastructure

Post 3: 🚀 The Solution: Space-based GPUs! 🛰️ Elon believes we’re heading towards a singularity where data centers require a terawatt of power. Solar power in space is the answer – 5x more efficient than on Earth, no batteries needed! "It will then get ridiculously better to be in space." #SpaceSolar

Post 4: 🏭 Scaling Challenges: It's not just about the GPUs. Turbine blade manufacturing is the bottleneck. "The limiting factor… is the vanes and blades in the turbines." SpaceX & Tesla might need to start making their own. #ManufacturingBottlenecks

Post 6: 🤖 The Future:  Elon expects AI in space to surpass Earth-based AI within 3-4 years. He envisions a future with "10,000 Starship launches a year" to orbit and a mass driver on the Moon.  "I think we'll find we're in the singularity..." #SpaceX #AIRevolution
