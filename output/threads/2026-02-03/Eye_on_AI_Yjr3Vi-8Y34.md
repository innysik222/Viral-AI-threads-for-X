# Why Traditional App Security Fails in the Age of AI (2026-02-03)

Post 1: 🚨 Your phone holds EVERYTHING – credit card info, SSN, health data. But are you *really* secure? This interview reveals how traditional app security is failing in the AI era, and it's terrifying. 🤯 Show more... #AIsecurity #mobilesecurity #dataprivacy

Post 2: 💥 The core problem? Security used to be about code. Now, it's about *behavior* and *intent*. "Historically, security was about protecting code... today it is more understanding about the behavior, the intent, the outcome of the system." - Shubhalder, AppNox #securityshift #AI

Post 3: 🤯 Release cycles are *insane*. Used to be months, now it's days. APIs are multiplying. Apps are "living systems" constantly adapting. Traditional security models can't keep up. It's a category shift. #appdev #agile #securityrisk

Post 4: 🛠️ AI is changing everything. Anyone can now build a mobile app. This breaks assumptions about security. Bad actors are exploiting this, creating "fake apps" that steal data. 💔 "If you look at applications in mobile, those are a little bit more restrictive." #AIthreat #appstore #scam

Post 5: 🔍 AI is being used to find these fake apps, but the arms race is on. "We are moving from securing software as an object to securing software as a living system." - Shubhalder.  This means constant vigilance & adaptation are *essential*. #AIvsAI #cybersecurity

Post 6: 🔑 Trust is eroding. Transparency is key. Companies need to show *how* they process data. "If I transparently tell the users this is how I process your data… you start building trust."  Data residency & privacy are paramount. #trust #dataprotection #transparency

Post 7: 🚀 The future: AI agents battling AI agents in a constant security dance. Developers need to level up, focusing on higher-order problems. Are you prepared for the next evolution of mobile security? What proactive steps are you taking? #futureofsecurity #AIevolution #securitymindset
