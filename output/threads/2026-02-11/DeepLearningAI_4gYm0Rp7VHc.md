# Use A2A to connect agents across different frameworks and teams (2026-02-11)

Post 1: 🤯 Agents…talking to *each other*?! Forget APIs. Forget custom integrations. IBM & Google just dropped a protocol called A2A that’s about to redefine how AI teams collaborate. This isn't just an update; it's a paradigm shift. 🧵👇 #AI #AgentAI #A2A #Innovation

Post 2: The problem? Agents built on different frameworks (Langgraph, Google Agent Development Kit, etc.) rarely play nice. Custom integrations are a nightmare. A2A solves this. It's an *open protocol* standardizing agent discovery & communication. Think TCP/IP for AI. 🌐 #OpenSource #AICollaboration

Post 3: "A2A is emerging as the industry standard." – Skinner Ivan Nardini. Big claim, huge implications. This means the skills you build around A2A are going to be *incredibly* valuable.  It's like learning HTTP in the early days of the web. 🚀 #FutureofWork #AISkills

---
Post 4: How does it work? ⚙️ Client-Server model. An A2A client (embedded in an app or agent) sends requests to an A2A server hosting other agents. This allows teams to build agents *independently* & connect them seamlessly.  No more monolithic AI systems! #Architecture #AgentFrameworks

---
Post 5: Key takeaways:
*  Hierarchical workflows: Orchestrators delegate tasks to specialized agents, regardless of framework.
*  Reuse & Update:  Update agents *without* refactoring entire systems.
*  Open Source: Donated to the Linux Foundation - community-governed & accessible. 🤝
*  Works with MCP: Integrates with existing protocols for external data access. #TechDetails

Post 6:  The collaboration between IBM & Google is a *massive* deal.  A2A builds on IBM's ACP & is now the go-to for standardized agent communication.  Think of it: Agents from Google, IBM, and your own custom builds...all working together. 🤯  #Google #IBM #Collaboration

Post 7:  A2A isn't just about connecting agents; it's about unlocking a new era of distributed AI development. Will this be the foundation for the next generation of intelligent systems? What applications do *you* see for A2A?  Dive into the course – link in bio! 🔗 #AIStrategy #ThoughtLeadership
