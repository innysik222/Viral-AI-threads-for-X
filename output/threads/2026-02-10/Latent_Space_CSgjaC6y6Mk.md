# ⚡️ Reverse Engineering OpenAI's Training Data — Pratyush Maini, Datology (2026-02-10)

Post 1: 🤯 OpenAI isn't just training models; they're *engineering* their training data. New interview with @Dtology's Pratyush Maini reveals a shocking truth about how frontier models like GPT-4 are built. You won't believe what they're doing with exam questions... ➡️ #AI #GPT4 #DataScience #OpenAI

Post 2: 🤯 The "Data is Weird" channel at @Dtology is a goldmine. They find bizarre artifacts in datasets, feeding them back into models. One recent find: models are *overfitting* on Indian Olympiad exam questions, even completing them with options given just the first two words! 🤯 #DataNerds #AIResearch

Post 3: "Models today are being massively like kind of fine-tuned on problems from overfit." - Pratyush Maini. 🤯 This isn't just about memorization; it's a systemic issue. Even smaller models (20B params) are exhibiting this behavior.  Are we optimizing for memorization, not reasoning? #AIethics #Overfitting

Post 4: 🤯 The "Seahorse Emoji" incident reveals a crucial insight. GPT-4's self-correcting behavior (yes/no loop) *didn't exist* until the GPT-4.1 release, coinciding with the integration of "thinking traces" in training. This isn’t just a bug; it's intentional. #GPT5 #AIdevelopment

Post 5: 🔑 Key takeaway: Frontier models now *require* "thinking traces" during foundation training. It’s not just about post-training fine-tuning. “The self-reflection is a capability that we desire and it’s become core to the foundation." - Pratyush Maini. #FoundationModels #AIStrategy

Post 6: 💡 @Dtology is pioneering "source rephrasing" - transforming existing web data into higher-quality training sets.  This is cheaper & more effective than generating entirely synthetic data.  Forget massive generator models; it's about smart data *transformation*. #SyntheticData #AIinnovation

Post 7: Alpha Take: The era of "bolt-on" AI capabilities is over.  Future models will be defined by the *data* they're trained on, not just their size. What specialized datasets will unlock the next generation of AI? Share your thoughts! 👇 #AIfuture #DataIsKing

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized, digital artwork depicting a vast, interconnected network of data streams swirling around a central, glowing brain-like structure. Within the data streams, subtle images of exam questions, the seahorse emoji, and lines of code are visible. The overall aesthetic is futuristic and slightly unsettling, suggesting the power and complexity of AI training data. Color palette: Deep blues, electric greens, and subtle hints of orange. Style: Cyberpunk, data visualization, abstract.
