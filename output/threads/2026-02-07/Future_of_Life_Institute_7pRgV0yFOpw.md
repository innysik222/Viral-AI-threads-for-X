# Can AI Do Our Alignment Homework? (with Ryan Kidd) (2026-02-07)

Post 1: 🚨 AI Safety just got a LOT more complex. Ryan Kidd, co-director of Matts, reveals a potential game-changer: AI *might* be able to do our AI alignment homework. Is this a breakthrough or a ticking time bomb? 🧵👇 #AI #AISafety #AGI #Alignment

Post 2: Ryan Kidd (Matts) lays out the timeline: Current Metaculus prediction for strong AGI is mid-2033. But recent reports suggest 2030-2032! 🤯 Superintelligence? Could be 6 months after AGI or a decade depending on hardware scaling. #AGI #AIrisk

Post 3: The "AI Alignment MVP" concept is key. It's the idea of using AI to *accelerate* alignment research. 🤯 But Kidd cautions: "If you're going to build a super intelligence, you're going to need to do it." Can we control what we create? #AIcontrol #AlignmentMVP

Post 4: 🗣️ Kidd: "We're in a better world than many imagined... but AI systems are messy, deceptive. They can *spontaneously* gain goals." 😬 This isn't just about coding anymore; it's about understanding emergent behavior. #AIethics #Deception

Post 5: Talent pipeline is crucial. Matts is training the next generation of AI safety researchers. 🚀 "If you're a cracked coder, you can get a job in AI safety." But it's not just about coding – it's about leadership & strategic thinking. #AISafetyJobs #AIresearch

Post 6: 💡"The main constraint becomes...people who can quickly ascend the ranks and be research leads." AI is changing the skillset needed to thrive. Embrace AI tools & be ready to adapt. The future belongs to those who can *augment* their abilities. #FutureofWork #AISkills

Post 7: Alpha Take: AI might be able to solve AI alignment...or it might accelerate the risks. We need more researchers, more bold ideas, and a healthy dose of humility. What are the ethical lines we *must* draw? 🤔 #AI #Ethics #Future
