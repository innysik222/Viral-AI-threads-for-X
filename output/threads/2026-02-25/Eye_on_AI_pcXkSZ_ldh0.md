### 🧠 Deep Dive

**The Challenge of Combining AI**

Traditional AI development has focused on building ever-larger and more complex models. However, a growing consensus suggests that the next wave of progress will come from creatively leveraging existing models. The challenge is significant: most advanced AI models are proprietary, with limited access to their internal workings (the "weights").  This restricts traditional methods of merging or integrating these models.  Researchers at Sakana AI are tackling this head-on by developing evolutionary strategies that can effectively combine models even without direct access to their weights.

**Evolutionary AI: Mimicking Nature's Genius**

The core of Sakana AI's approach lies in evolutionary strategies. Drawing inspiration from natural selection, these algorithms create a population of AI agents, each tasked with solving a specific problem.  The best-performing agents – those producing the most promising solutions – are then "bred" together, with their strengths combined to create new generations of agents. This iterative process, akin to Darwinian evolution, allows the system to progressively refine and improve its performance, discovering novel combinations and solutions that might be missed by traditional methods.  This mirrors the concept of "quality diversity" where unusual, but potentially valuable, solutions are prioritized alongside top performers.

**The Promise of Collective AI Intelligence**

The researcher interviewed emphasizes that the ultimate goal is to create AI systems that function as a collective – a network of agents collaborating and building upon each other’s ideas. This concept is directly inspired by the way human intelligence operates: we are a species that thrives on collaboration and knowledge sharing. By enabling AI models to do the same, we can unlock a level of creativity and innovation that surpasses what any single model could achieve.  As the researcher stated, "I think more fundamentally or philosophically our intelligence as a species is not like a giant big brain we we are a collective intelligence of like you know 8 billion people walking around with 30 watts in in this thing here and we talk to each other and exchange ideas."

**AI Scientists and the Future of Innovation**

Sakana AI is pushing the boundaries even further with the development of "AI Scientists" – autonomous agents designed to conceive of new scientific ideas and even write academic papers. This represents a radical shift, where AI not only performs tasks but also actively drives the process of scientific discovery. The company's Disco Pop project, which used LLMs to generate and evolve LLM training algorithms, is a testament to this potential.

So this is how our human uh artificial or whether it's an artificial or biological intelligence is formed." - Researcher at Sakana AI.

### 🏁 Conclusion
Model merging, powered by evolutionary AI, represents a pivotal shift in the AI landscape. It's a move away from the relentless pursuit of ever-larger models and towards a more collaborative, decentralized, and ultimately more innovative approach to artificial intelligence. As these techniques mature, they hold the potential to reshape industries, accelerate scientific discovery, and fundamentally alter the way we interact with technology.
