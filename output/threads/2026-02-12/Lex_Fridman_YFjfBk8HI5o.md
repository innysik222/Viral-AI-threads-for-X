# OpenClaw: The Viral AI Agent that Broke the Internet - Peter Steinberger | Lex Fridman Podcast #491 (2026-02-12)

Post 1: 🤯 The AI agent that modifies its own code? Forget self-driving cars, we’re entering an era where software *evolves*. Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw, just dropped some mind-blowing insights on the Lex Fridman Podcast. 🧵👇 #AI #AgenticAI #OpenClaw #FutureofSoftware

Post 2: Steinberger built OpenClaw after realizing existing AI assistants weren't "doing enough." He prompted it into existence - essentially, gave it life with a single prompt. 🤯 "I just prompted it to existence, and then the agent would just modify its own software." #AIdevelopment #innovation

Post 3: 🗣️ "I actually think wipe coding is a slur." - Peter Steinberger. He prefers "agentic engineering," highlighting a shift in how we build software. It's not just writing code anymore, it's *orchestrating* agents. #programming #tech #agenticengineering

Post 4: 🗣️ "I used to write really long prompts. Now, I just talk." - Steinberger now builds with voice, even losing his voice in the process. The future of coding isn't typing, it’s conversation. 🤯 #voiceAI #futureofwork #coding

Post 5: OpenClaw's viral success isn't just about functionality, it's about *personality*. Steinberger’s embrace of quirks & a "lobster" theme resonated with users, fostering a vibrant community and even a social network ("MoldBook"). 🦞 #community #AIculture #OpenSource

Post 6:  Security is paramount. Steinberger emphasizes protecting your data and being aware of threats.  "A powerful AI agent with system-level access is a security minefield."  Knowledge is power – understand the risks *and* the potential. ⚠️ #AISecurity #Cybersecurity #OpenClaw

Post 7: OpenClaw isn't just a tool, it's a paradigm shift. We're moving beyond language models to *agents* that can act, learn, and even rewrite themselves. What does this mean for the future of work, creativity, and even our understanding of intelligence? 🤔 #AIrevolution #AgenticAI #FutureIsNow

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT: A stylized digital painting depicting a vibrant, bioluminescent lobster wearing a futuristic headset, surrounded by swirling code and interconnected nodes, representing the OpenClaw AI agent. The background should evoke a sense of both technological advancement and organic complexity, with a slight neon glow. Render in a cyberpunk aesthetic, with a focus on intricate details and a sense of movement.
