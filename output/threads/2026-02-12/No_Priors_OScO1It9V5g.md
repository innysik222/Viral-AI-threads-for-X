Post 2: Rivian isn't just building cars; they’re redefining transportation. RJ Scaringe says they've been focused on autonomy from day one. It’s not a feature, it's the *core* of their strategy. “Autonomy is always been part of the strategy, but it's now fully coming to life..." 🚀 #Autonomy #Innovation

Post 3: The biggest roadblock to EV adoption? Not range anxiety. According to Scaringe, it’s a *lack of choice*. "The EV adoption in the United States is a reflection of the lack of choice." Consumers want variety & personalization - they identify with their vehicles. 🚗💨 #EVAdoption #ConsumerChoice

Post 4: 🤯 HUGE reveal: Rivian completely rebuilt their autonomy platform from scratch in 2022. "We made the decision to redo it like clean sheet, you know, no legacy of what we had built." They ditched a rules-based system for a true AI architecture. Legacy automakers are stuck with "legacy" tech. #TechReset #AI

Post 5:  The “brain” of self-driving is the most expensive part. Rivian built their own chips for onboard inference to cut costs and control the entire system. "And so that's like an order imagine more expensive than any of the perception stack." 🧠💰 #Chips #SelfDriving #VerticalIntegration

Post 6: Scaringe's bold prediction: only 1-3 companies *globally* outside of China will have the ingredients to build truly competitive autonomous systems. Tesla, Whimo, & Rivian are in that exclusive club. The rest? "They will shrink to nothing." 😬 #MarketDisruption #AutoIndustry

Post 7: Alpha Take: The auto industry is facing a Darwinian moment. Those who embrace AI-driven autonomy & prioritize choice will thrive. The future isn't just about electric vehicles – it’s about *intelligent* vehicles. What's your take? 🤔 #FutureofCars #AIRevolution
